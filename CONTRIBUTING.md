# Contribution Guide

### Style
`knowledgebase_web` is built using `React.js` and `webpack`. Originally built using `create-react-app`, most of the configs originated from the boilerplate provided there. Linting is done with `eslint`, and follows a modified version of the Airbnb style guide.

Testing is done with `Jest` with `enzyme`, and `cypress.io`.
